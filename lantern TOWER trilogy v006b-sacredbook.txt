INTRO GENERAL
Intro - Story so far  :

In this amazing trilogy you play the role of Bruce Eel. Our hero, since he was a young boy was intrigued by the mysteries of the world! He was always looking for ghosts, hidden treasures and other mystical stuff!

When he grow up the flame was even bigger inside him. He managed to find the answer to the "Ultimate Question to Life,Universe and Everything!" , which was 24 -and NOT 42- as some other ignorant people believed!  

After that quest he focused on another quest! He wanted to know the "Ultimate Secret of Life,the Universe and Everything"! He was traveling all over the world to find clues. He already knew that the Secret was written on a scroll hidden somewhere and had a Guard that "even God was afraid"! That scroll was named "The Ultimate Scroll", because the first person who did reasearch about it was the famous French explorer Ultimate Play De Gam! 
Ultimate Play De Gam was a member of a 3 person team that was hunting ghosts. The team of Ghostbusters became known as "The Three Amigos". The leader of that team was Pacard Manford which was the man who was hunting clues in haunted mansions many years before the three friends met! Pacard had discovered that there was something hidden for hundrend of years. The decisive clue that led Pacard to his biggest discovery was an ancient map that was discovered after many years of searching by an older explorer known as Dr Robbie Pssst!

All the ancient scrolls told of stories that there were clues about the location of the Ultimate Scroll on a sacred book!
In many different locations and in the myths of many different civilisation he always found the same text. This text was also found in historic monuments like the Pyramids, The statue of liberty and cereal boxes :
"The sacred book will lead to a sacred artifact which will lead to the Ultimate Scroll!"
This was a curious inscription since Ultimate Play De Gam was born 5000 years after the last inscription. The first appearence of the inscription was in a prehistoric Cave writen in Caveman Fonts! It was discovered by the cook of a neanderthal tribe. That cook for some reason was drawn in many cave walls with a body that looked like a cookie! The archeologists named him "Cookie Man".

When the players wear blue and red colours! keep in mind the 4-4-1-1 system attack!
When the players wear blue clothes the wise men agreed that you will need 4-2-4 system or zone defence!
If you see Red and Black colors then use Catenaccio all the way!
