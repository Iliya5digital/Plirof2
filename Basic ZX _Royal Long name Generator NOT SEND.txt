Royal Name Generator
By Firelord Quality Games (c)2022

Introduction
Thank you for paying money to own this amazing piece of non-crap software! "Firelord Quality Games" will put your name in the fridge door together with the names of our other paying customers!
This utility was created because I saw many men trying to earn money just to find a rich supermodel girlfriend. The get rich part is easy -just sent me 50$ and tell 5 of your friends to also send me 50$ and I will tell you the secret! The second part is more tricky -the supermodel girlfriend! 
I did much research on how to attract a super pretty woman! The result of my research surprised me! Only one thing can make you go to bed a supermodel or with just your empty hands...
The secret is the size! YES! The size of your name! Many scientists and historians came in the conclusion that the size of the name reflects the size of one mans money!
You all think now that you somehow knew that! The explanation is simple: All serious men watch Spanish/Brazilian soap operas. In these TV shows most of the characters are filthy rich! Have you notised anythine else? The names are very long. Eg "Teresa García Ramírez de Arroyo" is one of the extremelly rich characters but "Juan Martínez Escudero Marta Villanueva Cortés" is even richer one!
Of course you can't just make up a long name. You need help!
This utility will help you generate a unique name that makes all women think that you're a royality!
